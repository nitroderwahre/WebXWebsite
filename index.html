        <h1>Hello! And welcome to my test website.</h1>
        <p>This is just a test of the new way to code a Website withou needing to use Java script.</p>
        <p>I will update this Website frequently with new stuff and hopefully other people will enjoy this website.</p>
        <p>As the website is rigth now, it's pretty bad I know, this is the first version of the website after all</p>
        <p>I will push a update after a few hours after I got used to the Lua stuff you can do on here.</p>
        <p></p>
        <p>Have a good day!</p>
